# VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES 
## 1. What are the key virtualization technologiescommonly used in DevOps practices?

#### Meet Ibrahim, he works as a software developer in an IT firm. And he often has to work on multiple projects involving different operating systems according to the requirements of the project. During which he often come across cases where managing of data becomes problematic due to compatibility issue with the different operating systems which makes it hard for the completion of the project. So what can Ibrahim do to overcome such a problem? Virtualization is the answer!  
Virtualization technology makes it possible to separate physical hardware resources (like CPU and storage) from computers. Most famously, it’s the foundation of cloud computing. Hypervisors play a key role in the process of virtualization. 

**Virtualization** is a technology that enables the creation of virtual instances or representation of computer resources, such as servers, storage, networks, or operating systems within a single physical machine. Virtualization allows multiple virtual environments to coexist independently, sharing underlying hardware resources.
Virtualization Technology
Virtualization requires the use of hypervisor, which was originally called a virtual machine monitor. 
<u>**Hypervisor**</u>: A hypervisor is a crucial piece of software that makes virtualization possible. It creates a virtualization layer that separates the actual hardware components – processors, RAM, storage and other physical resources from the actual machines and the system they run. The machine hosting a hypervisor is called the host machine, while the virtual instances running on top of the hypervisor are known as the guest virtual machines.

* **<u>Docker</u>** - for containerization, enabling lightweight, portable environments.
* **<u>Kubernetes</u>** - for container orchestration, managing large-scale container deployments.
* **<u>VMware</u>** - for creating and managing virtual machines.
* **<u>Vagrant</u>** - for building and managing virtualized development environments.
* **<u>Hyper-V</u>** - for Windows-based virtual machine management.

##  2.	How does containerization (e.g., Docker) compare to traditional virtualization (e.g., VMware) in DevOps environments? 
Containerization (e.g., Docker) is more lightweight than traditional virtualization (e.g., VMware). Containers share the host OS kernel, making them faster to start and requiring fewer resources. In contrast, traditional virtualization uses full virtual machines, each with its own OS, which adds overhead but provides stronger isolation. Containers are ideal for microservices and rapid scaling in DevOps, while virtual machines are better for running multiple OS environments or heavier, monolithic applications.

# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
